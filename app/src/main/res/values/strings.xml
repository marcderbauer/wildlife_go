    <string name="elephants">"Tens of thousands of elephants are being killed every year for their skin (to make jewerly and medicinal cures) and ivory tusks. The ivory is often carved into ornaments and jewellery â€“ China is the biggest consumer market for such products. They are also being sold into slavery in circuses, zoos and safari parks, where they are being abused behind the scenes but where the owners earn a lot of money from paying spectators. Some types of elephants like the African elephants, Desert elephants od Namibia etc are the most ednangered elephants in the world. The countries where they can be found are India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Vietnam and Thailand, Brunei, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar and Nepal. Asian Elephants are endangered species and are less in number than African Elephants. Elephants have been working animals since at least the Indus Valley Civilization and continue to be used in modern times. They are the largest living land animal. They are herbivorous and will eat leaves, twigs, fruit, bark, grass and roots and they stay near water when it is accessible. Touching is an important form of communication among elephants. Individuals greet each other by stroking or wrapping their trunks; the latter also occurs during mild competition. In many cultures, elephants represent strength, power, wisdom, longevity, stamina, leadership, sociability, nurturance and loyalty.  "</string>
